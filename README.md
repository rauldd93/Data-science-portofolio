# Raúl Díaz | Ecologist & Data Scientist

Bridging Complex Ecological Systems with Advanced Data Analysis

# 👋 About Me
I am a Ph.D. ecologist and data scientist specializing in functional ecology, community assembly, and ecological modeling. My research deciphers complex ecological patterns by combining rigorous field experimentation in challenging environments with advanced statistical computing.

I transform heterogeneous, multidimensional ecological data—from physiological traits to community matrices—into clear insights using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), multivariate analyses, and custom computational pipelines. My work is driven by a deep curiosity for how organisms adapt and communities assemble across environmental gradients.

I am actively seeking roles where I can apply my expertise in ecological data analysis, statistical modeling, and scientific programming to challenges in environmental consulting, conservation tech, ecological research, or data science in the life sciences.

A selection of my peer-reviewed research. All projects involved significant data wrangling, statistical modeling, and coding in R.

# Community & Functional Ecology

- Díaz, R., et al. (2023). Lichen diversity and community assembly along elevational gradients in mountains of central Argentina. Cryptogamie Mycologie (Accepted).

Core PhD work. Analyzed heterogeneous species abundance, frequency, and functional trait data using GLMMs and multivariate ordination techniques (e.g., NMDS, PERMANOVA) to disentangle assembly drivers.

- Díaz, R., et al. (2022). Water regulation dynamics of lichens as functional traits could predict future climate change scenarios. The Bryologist. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1639/0007-2745-125.3.466)

Pioneered novel functional trait measurements. Managed a complex experimental design (elevation × microsite) and analyzed responses using mixed-effects models.

# Ecophysiology & Climate Response

- Díaz, R., et al. (2024). Phenotypic plasticity in two saxicolous lichen species: Elevation and microsite effects on physiological and biochemical responses.

Key Data Challenge: Integrated disparate data types (chemical concentrations, water kinetics, morphology) into a unified analytical framework using a suite of generalized linear mixed models.

- Díaz, R., et al. (2023). Quantitative variation of usnic acid in response to elevation and microsite conditions... chemometric modeling for predicting climate change effects. Mycological Progress. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11557-023-01904-6)

Built predictive chemometric models linking environmental gradients to chemical compound variation.

# Biomonitoring & Applied Ecology

Developed a novel protocol and tackled associated data processing/analysis challenges.

- Martínez-Berni, L., Díaz, R., et al. (2024). Concentración de azufre bioacumulado en líquenes en áreas verdes urbanas de Asunción, Paraguay. Annals of Botany. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.20937/RICA.55074) (*Co-first author)

Designed experiment and analyzed data to assess urban air pollution using lichens as bioindicators.

# Synthesis & Review
